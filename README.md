# Version and Requirements  
* Python == 3.6.9
* pip3 install -r requirements.txt

#  Preprocessing The Data
**MICC-F2000**
* Download [MICC-F2000](http://lci.micc.unifi.it/labd/2015/01/copy-move-forgery-detection-and-localization/) dataset    
* Unzip MICC-F2000.zip    
*NOTE:The dataset contains a file named: nikon7_scale.jpg. It has to be renamed as nikon_7_scale.jpg.*       


# Colab and TPU(Tensor Processing Unit)
*TPUâ€™s have been recently added to the Google Colab portfolio making it even more attractive for quick-and-dirty machine learning projects when your own local processing units are just not fast enough. While the **Tesla K80** available in Google Colab delivers respectable **1.87 TFlops** and has **12GB RAM**, the **TPUv2** available from within Google Colab comes with a whopping **180 TFlops**, give or take. It also comes with **64 GB** High Bandwidth Memory **(HBM)**.*
